This repo is an unorganized collection of random ideas for a new kind of programming language.  *Consider it just a back of an envelope.*

Please take everything you find in this repo with a grain of salt.  Many features aren't going to not withstand the test of time.  Many part of the syntax will disappear, and need to be made consistent over time.
